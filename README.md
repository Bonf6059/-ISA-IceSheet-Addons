This mod depend on vanilla expanded framework made by the vanilla expanded team; some of the element in this mod are inspired by some of the mods of the Vanilla Expanded team (Vanilla factions expanded-Insectoid, vanilla animals expanded-ice sheet) , and is dependent on the last one due to technical difficulties (I'm unable to create file audio for the animals) the rest has been created by me. Do whatever you want with the code but you must quote me.
